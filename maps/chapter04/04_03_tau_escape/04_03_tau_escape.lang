        <Entry Name="dialog_3_rosstunnelchat_004_player_001">What?! How?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_rosstunnelchat_005_flesher_001">The enslaved protein sloshing around your suit is the noose from which the WAU will hang itself.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_rosstunnelchat_006_player_001">What are you talking about?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_rosstunnelchat_007_flesher_001">As soon as I came to in Omicron. I tried to tell them to make the toxin that would make the WAU wither.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_rosstunnelchat_007_flesher_002">But they didn&apos;t understand. They put it inside a cabinet. It was so infuriating. They needed to take it to Alpha, the fountainhead of the misery we created.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_rosstunnelchat_007_flesher_003">And then the girl, she figured it out. She was going to take care of it -- but the WAU shrieked!</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_rosstunnelchat_007_flesher_004">They all died -- but you, you! You took the gel from the cabinet and made yourself into a venomous snake.</Entry>

        <Entry Name="dialog_3_rossenterwauroom_002_flesher_001">The heart. It controls all the structure gel on Pathos-II.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_rossenterwauroom_002_flesher_002">All you need to do is poison the imprint and the heart will unwillingly spread it across Pathos-II. Killing it.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_rossenterwauroom_002_flesher_003">Feed it, Simon. Push your arm into the heart.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_simonafterrossdeath_losthand_001_player_001">I&apos;m sorry, WAU! I didn&apos;t mean to infect you! Please let me go.</Entry>

        <Entry Name="dialog_3_rossdemandsimondoit_3_002_player_001">Back off, okay.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_rossdemandsimondoit_4_001_flesher_001">Please, Simon.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_rossdemandsimondoit_5_001_flesher_001">Don&apos;t let the earth be consumed by WAU&apos;s nightmares.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_2_rossbanter_1_001_flesher_001">This is where it all went wrong, Simon. Site Alpha.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_2_rossbanter_2_001_flesher_001">This is where we planted the seed to the cancer that&apos;s eating Pathos-II.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_2_rossbanter_3_001_flesher_001">It wasn&apos;t meant to be like this. No one told us this could happen.</Entry>

        <Entry Name="dialog_3_wauswallowsross_noarm_001_player_001">Please, I did what you wanted.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_wauswallowsross_noarm_002_flesher_001">You did good, Simon. But you can&apos;t leave.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_wauswallowsross_noarm_002_flesher_002">The only way to make sure the WAU stays dead is to destroy the only one who&apos;s immune to the new pattern.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_wauswallowsross_noarm_003_flesher_001">Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll make it quick.</Entry>
